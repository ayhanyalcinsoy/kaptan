? Not determined if/how we have to do
/ In progress
+ Accomplished

TODO:
/ Fork everything. (Change paths, etc.)
/ Fix package management page, use spun (enable/disable audio
        notifications; fix config stuff to work with .spunrc)
        Still incomplete: disable spun at startup
? Fix Themes/Style page, add screenshots for Caledonia as well as
        any others included on the livecd by default
        Still imcomplete: 
- Add all new screens to scrSummary as we go
- Add page for choosing services to add to rc.conf, like cups, bluetooth
        (have a few default options, and a button to open rcconf_settings)
        Still incomplete: rc daemons editong module for python
        Unless systemd is ready, then it will be easy.
- Add page for creating folders in $HOME (Pictures, Documents, Music,
        Downloads, Videos, custom; if a dir already exists, hide option)
/ Create custom Chakra/Kapudan artwork to replace the Kaptan logos
        In progress by artists???
- Add page for choosing KDM theme, with whatever the current theme is
